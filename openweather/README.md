Projet "openweather" allows to connect to https://openweathermap.org/ via API code and download
weather data for a particular city or all cities of a particular country.
Downloaded data is stored in sqlite database.
There are 2 scripts:
  - "openweather.py" dowloads and stores the date - shell script
  - "export_openweather.py" - shell script which takes params for export mode (--csv/--xml/--html) and name of city (optional)
